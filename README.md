# Introduction
Hello, I'm Shasha, the front-end developer for our team. We have developed a comprehensive tournament system that integrates front-end, back-end, and database management functionalities. However, due to current data inaccessibility and my work focusing on front-end development, I've tailored this demo to showcase the screens I created based on our client's specifications. The design reflects their requirements, and we collaborated closely with them to ensure their needs were met.

# Demo Information
Upon running the server, you can click on the various screens to access them. Please note that the back-end components in the HTML files have been commented out for the purpose of this demo.

# Contributions
This project was created with the invaluable efforts of my wonderful teammates. My primary contributions include:
Bracketing Screen: One of the highest functionality requirements
Schedule Viewing and Display
Base Template for all the Forms
Base Template of the overall system

The system was created with HTML, CSS, Python, JavaScript, Django, and Bootstrap.
