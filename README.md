# Introduction
Hello, I'm Shasha, the front-end developer for our team. We have developed a comprehensive tournament system that integrates front-end, back-end, and database management functionalities. However, due to current data inaccessibility and my work focusing on front-end development, I've tailored this demo to showcase the screens I created based on our client's specifications. The design reflects their requirements, and we collaborated closely with them to ensure their needs were met.

# Demo Information
1. Download the files or clone the repository to your machine.
2. Set up a Python virtual environment by running python -m venv Splatourney.
3. Activate virtual environment by running source Splatourney/bin/activate for macOS, and Splatourney\Scripts\activate for Windows.
4. Install Django by running pip install Django in your IDE terminal.
5. Navigate to manage.py by running cd SplatourneySystem
6. Run the system through the command python manage.py runserver
7. Upon running the server, you may click on the respective screen buttons to access them. Please note that the back-end components in the HTML files have been commented out for the purpose of this demo.

# Contributions
This project was created with the invaluable efforts of my wonderful teammates. My primary contributions include:
Bracketing Screen: One of the highest functionality requirements
Schedule Viewing and Display
Base Template for all the Forms
Base Template of the overall system

The system was created with HTML, CSS, Python, JavaScript, Django, and Bootstrap.
Thank you!
